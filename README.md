# react-ssr-boilerplate

This is a simple boilerplate application demonstrating server-side rendering and basic data retrieval. Built with [React], the application is universal (WIP ðŸš§), insofar as it can be served by a standard webserver and rendered on the client (see [CSR]) or served by the included [Express] server which provides server-side rendering (see [SSR]).

No `create-react-app` here, this is all custom `webpack`, `eslint`, and `babel` configuration!

## Why SSR?
Server-side rendering seems, to me, a good approach for this type of website. The faster First Contentful Paint ([FCP]) means that prospective clients / employersâ€”likely pressed for time and with many candidates a click awayâ€”will spend `500 - 2,000ms` more on one's portfolio. It also means that web crawlers will more easily crawl the app's content and links, a key ingredient in the dark arts of SEO.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn bundle-dev`
Executes Webpack with the `watch` and `debug` flags.

### `yarn start-dev`
Executes `nodemon` with `babel-node` on the file `./src/server/server.js`.

Run these two in tandem to compile changes on the fly and refresh the Express server.
