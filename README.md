# react-ssr-boilerplate

This is a simple boilerplate application demonstrating server-side rendering and basic data retrieval. Built with [React], the application is universal (WIP ðŸš§), insofar as it can be served by a standard webserver and rendered on the client (see [CSR]) or served by the included [Express] server which provides server-side rendering (see [SSR]). See below for details.
